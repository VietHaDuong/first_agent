# First Agent
## Overview
This project represents my first attempt at building an autonomous AI agent. Unlike standard chatbots, this agent determines the best tool to solve a user's problem. It leverages **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** for speed and low latency, but can also run locally using **Ollama**.

**Capabilities:**
* **Web Search:** Fact-checking and current events (via Tavily).
* **Document QA:** Retrieval Augmented Generation for PDF files.
* **Live Weather:** Real-time meteorological data (via OpenWeather).

## 🔮 Future Improvements
* Implement a "Reasoning Loop" (Chain of Thought) visualization.
* Add support for CSV and Excel files.
